# monalisa-image-manipulation

Mona Lisa is one of my favorite paintings. So I decided to experiment and manipulate the image. The product of my image manipulation was not entirely my initial intention, because I arrived at the current outcome upon various trials and failures. First, I manipulated the painting in a way that the image is transformed to a black&white image and disintegrated into small ellipses when the cursor is moved. Following the X and Y axis, the gap and the number of ellipses change, creating a sort of 3D-animated effect from my perspective. Another aspect I decided to add was a certain change when the mouse is pressed. When the mouse is pressed, the cursor turns into a spotlight. I feel that this adds to the somewhat eerie and mysterious atmosphere of my creation. You can find my attempts and addition of different aspect in the videos below.
